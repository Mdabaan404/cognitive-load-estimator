# Cognitive Load Estimator via Webcam

This Python project estimates a user's **cognitive load** in real time using webcam input. It uses **computer vision** (OpenCV, MediaPipe) to extract facial features like blink rate, eye movement scatter, facial microexpressions, and head movement. These features are then fed into a **machine learning model** to predict mental workload (low or high).

-  Blink rate analysis (fatigue detection)
-  Eye movement scatter (attention/distraction detection)
-  Facial microexpression tracking (frown, squint, mouth open)
-  Machine Learning classifier (Random Forest / Logistic Regression)
-  Scalable attention scoring system
-  Alerts or logs cognitive load levels
-  Collect your own data for training and retraining
